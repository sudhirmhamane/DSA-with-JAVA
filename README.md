## Introduction

This project includes implementations of various data structures and algorithms, including but not limited to:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms

The goal is to provide clear and concise implementations that can be used as a reference for learning and understanding these concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Java installed on your machine. You can download it from [Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Running the Code

Navigate to the directory of the desired Java file and compile it using:

```bash
javac <filename>.java
```

Then run the compiled class with:

```bash
java <filename>
```
